# Test serverless log repo

This repo is a test instance for the [serverless log & GitHub actions](https://github.com/google/trillian-examples/tree/master/serverless).

For the curious, it's a transparency log stored in the form of static files,
and is being automatically updated with a GitHub Action from the above repo.
